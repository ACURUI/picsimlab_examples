  <h1>Arduino Serial Bootloader for Atmel megaAVR Controllers </h1>

/*****************************************************************************
Title:     STK500v2 compatible bootloader
           Modified for Wiring board ATMega128-16MHz
Author:    Peter Fleury <pfleury@gmx.ch>   http://jump.to/fleury
Compiler:  avr-gcc 3.4.5 or 4.1 / avr-libc 1.4.3
Hardware:  All AVRs with bootloader support, tested with ATmega8
License:   GNU General Public License

Modified:  Worapoht Kornkaewwattanakul <dev@avride.com>   http://www.avride.com
Date:      17 October 2007
Update:    1st, 29 Dec 2007 : Enable CMD_SPI_MULTI but ignore unused command by return 0x00 byte response..
Compiler:  WINAVR20060421
Description: add timeout feature like previous Wiring bootloader

DESCRIPTION:
    This program allows an AVR with bootloader capabilities to
    read/write its own Flash/EEprom. To enter Programming mode
    an input pin is checked. If this pin is pulled low, programming mode
    is entered. If not, normal execution is done from $0000
    "reset" vector in Application area.
    Size fits into a 1024 word bootloader section
	when compiled with avr-gcc 4.1
	(direct replace on Wiring Board without fuse setting changed)

USAGE:
    - Set AVR MCU type and clock-frequency (F_CPU) in the Makefile.
    - Set baud rate below (AVRISP only works with 115200 bps)
    - compile/link the bootloader with the supplied Makefile
    - program the "Boot Flash section size" (BOOTSZ fuses),
      for boot-size 1024 words:  program BOOTSZ01
    - enable the BOOT Reset Vector (program BOOTRST)
    - Upload the hex file to the AVR using any ISP programmer
    - Program Boot Lock Mode 3 (program BootLock 11 and BootLock 12 lock bits) // (leave them)
    - Reset your AVR while keeping PROG_PIN pulled low // (for enter bootloader by switch)
    - Start AVRISP Programmer (AVRStudio/Tools/Program AVR)
    - AVRISP will detect the bootloader
    - Program your application FLASH file and optional EEPROM file using AVRISP

Note:
    Erasing the device without flashing, through AVRISP GUI button "Erase Device"
    is not implemented, due to AVRStudio limitations.
    Flash is always erased before programming.

	AVRdude:
	Please uncomment #define REMOVE_CMD_SPI_MULTI when using AVRdude.
	Comment #define REMOVE_PROGRAM_LOCK_BIT_SUPPORT to reduce code size
	Read Fuse Bits and Read/Write Lock Bits is not supported

NOTES:
    Based on Atmel Application Note AVR109 - Self-programming
    Based on Atmel Application Note AVR068 - STK500v2 Protocol
